# The project connects two players to play a platform game with 99 levels.

Development:

The game uses a client-server model, with a dedicated server and clients that connect to play.

Motion replication is used to ensure that all players see the same scene.

Custom widgets have been created to display game information.

Mobile platforms have been implemented with server physics and authority.

Platform triggers were created to activate and deactivate platforms based on player interaction.

A menu system has been implemented to select levels and manage gameplay.
